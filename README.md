# Mobile Flashcards
This is the final project for the React Native portion of [Udacity's React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

## Dependencies
This app has not been published to the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/ios/id36?mt=8) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps?hl=en). As such it's easiest to run the app using [Expo](https://expo.io/). The React Native documentation has [great instructions for getting started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) that includes information about setting up Expo for use on your phone or a simulator.

## Installation and Launch Instructions
- Install the necessary packages with `yarn install`
- Launch the application with `yarn start`
- Access the application using Expo (see Dependencies section above)

## Tested Platforms
This app should work fully on Android.

iOS functionality should be near complete, but I didn't bother to find a work around for [this Expo bug](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/101) that prevents the app from getting correct permission information on iOS (and results in notifications not being set on iOS).

## Create React Native App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

More information about Create React Native App including information about performing common tasks is available [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md).
